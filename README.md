My program was written in Python and consists of five .py files: main.py, productos.py, ventas.py, reportes.py, and inventario_ventas.py.

In main.py, you'll find the core code flow, including a function called menu, which displays the menu options to the user. There's also a main function that allows the user to choose an option, and based on their selection, the functions created in the other files are invoked.

The inventario_ventas.py file contains two lists: one called inventario_prod with product dictionaries, and another called ventas, which is empty.

The productos.py file contains the CRUD operations for everything related to the products.

The ventas.py file contains two functions: one to add a sale and another to display all sales made.

Finally, the reportes.py file contains a lambda function to determine the top three best-selling products and the net revenue with and without discounts.
